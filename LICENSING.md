# Hardware
Any person, persons, and/or company may freely use any of my designs or environments under the GPLv3.
Meaning, if any changes are made to the designs they must remain free and open under the GPLv3.
Any hardware generated from said designs will of course be your own and I have no right to them in any way,
be it in credit of authorship or monitary.
The designs belong to everyone, the hardware belongs to you.

That being said, I would greatly appreciate it if any users would inform me of their intent to use of any of this code.
