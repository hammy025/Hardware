# Hardware
The intention of this repository is to create synthesizable designs (generally related to networking technology) in verilog HDL
and the environments to fully test them.
Initially the environments will be in SystemVerilog only (since all I have is Icarus Verilog).
Later environments will hopefully include UVM as well.

Simply browse the 'rtl' directory for a list of the designs.
The 'rtl/common/' directory has various common designs used in multiple designs.
